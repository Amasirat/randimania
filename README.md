# Randomizer

Personal simple program that randomizers n number of elements.

# System
Randomized elements are structured as different groups. The user creates groups and inputs elements into them, and the program stores them inside a csv file. When the user asks for n elements back, the program will randomize and show them to the user.

# Usage
"program name" "operation" "input parameters"(seperated by space)

Operations:

add-group, 1 input parameter -> "name of group"

add-elements, 2 or more input parameters -> "group name" "element 1" "element 2" ... "element n" 

pull-random, 2 input parameters -> "group name" "number of elements desired"
